          <p class="curriculum-text">Hi! I am an English language teacher and a freelancer translator working with English and Brazilian Portuguese language pair.</p>
          <p class="curriculum-text">Passionate about languages and the human connection made possible by language and communication, I started teaching English in 2010. Since then, I have acquired professional experience as an English teacher with all levels and ages, groups and individuals, in person and online.</p>
          <p class="curriculum-text">I have a degree in Law from the Faculty of Law of São Bernardo do Campo (Brazil) and acted as a lawyer until 2017. In 2018, I started living in the US. I have started studying fundamentals of grammar in Harvard Extension School, and a course for teachers of English for speakers of other languages (TESOL) in Arizona State University. I have joined two research groups about teaching English for justice through a translanguaging perspective.</p>
          <p class="curriculum-text">Translation has been a part of my professional routine in Law since 2012, when I was responsible for the translation and version of agreements, legal opinions, and other documents, especially in the fields of entertainment and intellectual property law. Besides legal translation, I also have experience with transation and version in audiovisual, social sciences, marketing, and other areas.</p>
          <p class="curriculum-text">Let's work together! Send me an message at contact@mairalp.com or via my professional pages linked above.</p>
